SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

================================================================
Part 2 (Part 1 not required)
Estimated Time    HH 40
Plan:
First, copy the original prime.c into a new file prime_standard.c. 
Update variable names, function names, and constants to follow the coding 
standards (lowercase variables, descriptive names, #define for constants). 
Add purpose-based comments for functions and loops. 
Incrementally test the program after each set of changes to ensure that it 
still compiles and produces correct results. 
Update the Makefile so it builds prime_standard.c instead of prime.c. 
Finally, fix the logic so that "2 is a prime" prints in the correct order 
without duplication.

Complete
Actual Time    HH 75
Observations:
I initially left a hardcoded value (UpperBound = 50) in the code, which 
prevented the program from respecting user input. Fixing that was one of 
the first debugging steps. When rewriting, I learned the importance of 
consistent naming conventions for readability and maintainability. 
Another obstacle was handling the printing of "2 is a prime." My first 
solution caused 2 to print at the end, and later I accidentally had it 
print twice. I corrected this by printing 2 before the main loop and 
removing the duplicate. Through this exercise I learned how following 
standards helps avoid confusion, and I also gained practice in debugging 
logic errors introduced by restructuring code.
